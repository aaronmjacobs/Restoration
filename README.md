### Overview / Synopsis

The world has become desolate. Everyone I knew and loved... My family, my friends... Have been taken by the Umbran. They ravaged the land… But I will stop them. I will traverse across this ruinous landscape using the sacred Keys of Wasd, leaping and bounding using the Bar of Space over all obstacles in my way. I have been chosen by destiny, it seems, for I have been given the power to vanquish them. By using my Vis - my life energy - I can purify those monsters and add their life to my own. My Vis already purifies the world around me, giving me a tangible, visible hope. By channeling my Vis, I can fire a Justitia blast in whatever direction the Arrow of Guidance chooses. This is the only weapon that can stop the many kinds of Umbrans that I will face. The Corona, the rank-and-file pawns, just walk back and forth; showing that they’re tactics are as empty as their hearts. The Obex, the automated traps, hinder my advancing. Their spikes are strong, but their paths are easy to follow and overcome. The Turris, the steadfast towers, aim to shoot me down while maintaining their ground. They too can channel their Vis, firing Aegrum wherever I go. Luckily, my Justitia can block their Aegrum. The Vagus, the dive-bombing fiends, lie in wait for my arrival. They don’t seem to be alive until I come close, and then they relentlessly pursue. The Magus, the , is the most tenacious of all. His Aegrum are lethal, and his movements misleading and sudden. I must take him down quickly, before he gets the chance to fight back. The Judex, the fallen Judge, awaits me at the end of my quest. I must conquer him if I am to save this world. I must not fail in my endeavor… I shall not fail! This world has waited too long for its Restoration.

**Shadow Mapping**

Point light with high resolution shadows by having the projection be a constant bias away from the character at all times. The orthographic projection only encompasses the visibile scene.

### Welcome to GitHub Pages.
This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:

```
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
```

If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.

### Rather Drive Stick?
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
