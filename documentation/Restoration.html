<h2>Overview/Synopsis</h2>
The world has become desolate. Everyone I knew and loved… My family, my friends… Have been taken by the Umbran.  <br>
They ravaged the land… But I will stop them. I will traverse across this ruinous landscape using the sacred Keys of Wasd, leaping and bounding using the Bar of Space over all obstacles in my way.<br>
I have been chosen by destiny, it seems, for I have been given the power to vanquish them. By using my Vis - my life energy - I can purify those monsters and add their life to my own.<br>
My Vis already purifies the world around me, giving me a tangible, visible hope. By channeling my Vis, I can fire a Justitia blast in whatever direction the Arrow of Guidance chooses.<br>
This is the only weapon that can stop the many kinds of Umbrans that I will face. The Corona, the rank-and-file pawns, just walk back and forth; showing that they’re tactics are as empty as their hearts.<br>
The Obex, the automated traps, hinder my advancing. Their spikes are strong, but their paths are easy to follow and overcome. <br>
The Turris, the steadfast towers, aim to shoot me down while maintaining their ground. They too can channel their Vis, firing Aegrum wherever I go.<br>
Luckily, my Justitia can block their Aegrum. The Vagus, the dive-bombing  fiends, lie in wait for my arrival. They don’t seem to  be alive until I come close, and then they relentlessly pursue. The Magus, the , is the most tenacious of all. His Aegrum are lethal, and his movements misleading and sudden. I must take him down quickly, before he gets the chance to fight back. The Judex, the fallen Judge, awaits me at the end of my quest. I must conquer him if I am to save this world. I must not fail in my endeavor… I shall not fail! This world has waited too long for its Restoration.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<center>
<table border="10">

<tr>
  <td>Shadow Map: </td> <td>Point light with high resolution shadows by having the projection be a constant bias away<br>
  from the character at all times. The orthographic projection only encompasses the visibile scene.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Animation: </td> <td>The system supports skeletal animation as well as switching between animations with a single call. <br>
  All animation transformations are applied on the GPU with a list of bones and weights computed on the CPU.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Animated Character: </td> <td>The main character, Leoht, has idle, running, and jump skeletal-based animations, fully textured in Maya.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Sphere:</td> <td>Using a stencil buffer, we specified what should be drawn in multiple render passes. Then, after<br>
  all framebuffers are set up, alpha blending is applied to the scene to merge the scenes together.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Ambient lighting: </td> <td>Ambient light color is determined by looking up a value from a heavily blurred version of the active skybox,<br>
  and averaging it with a global scene color. The end result is that objects appear to 'fit' better in the scene,<br>
  and their colors change between the light and dark render passes.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Ambient Occlusion: </td> <td>We have toggleable screen space ambient occlusion. This is achieved by bluring the depth buffer with the<br>
  application of a threshold, and then subtracting the original depth buffer. The values are then scaled and contained between 0 and 1. <br>
  The inverse of this value is applied to the alpha of the pixels of a black plane infront of the camera to get a basic ambient occlusion effect.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Particle Effects: </td> <td>The particle effects include a versatile particle effect function that creates a variable <br>
  number of particles with velocity, acceleration, spread, size, and duration.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Audio: </td> <td>Using FMod, a seperate class was packaged with the functionality to switch tracks, play tracks, and loop tracks.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Level Editor: </td> <td>The level editor started with a mouse trace from a 2D plane into a 3D world to easily select<br>
  objects. After we added abilities to use it more efficiently like copying and pasting objects.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>View Frustum Culling: </td> <td>Each object in the scene is checked against the view frustum. If the object, based on its bounding box,<br>
  is outside of the 6 planes of the view frustum, it is not drawn, saving effort by the GPU. The 6 planes are updated each draw call, based on<br>
  the view-projection matrix.</td>
